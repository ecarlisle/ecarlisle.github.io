When getting started with a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) site, it's very important to learn about its [directory structure](ahttp://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure) and how that works with the Jekyll generator. Most of this is very intuitative and you'll be quickly learning where to place templates, partials, posts, and general content pages.

You'll notice all the initial folders and the site configuration file begin with an underscore.

{% highlight text %}
.
├── _config.yml
├── _drafts
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _data
├── _site
└── index.html
{% endhighlight %}

These folders are essentially plumbing that Jekyll needs to generate the site. When adding new files and folders, however, the underscore convention is very important. By naming a resource with a preceding underscore, you're telling Jekyll to exclude that file or folder from the site's build process.

Let's add a few new resources to this site:

{% highlight text %}
.
├── _projects.html
├── contact.html
├── _images
└── scripts
{% endhighlight %}

On the next Jekyll build, the generator will ignore the `projects.html` file and `images` directory. The remaining items will be processed and placed into the `_site`, the default Jekyll destination directory.

{% highlight text %}
.
├── _projects.html
├── contact.html
├── _images
├── _site
|   ├── scripts
|   └── contact.html
└── scripts
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty straight forward, right? A straight-forward convention that's easy to remember. What could possibly go wrong?

One day I started noticing that my Jekyll builds were taking upwards of 2-3 minutes.  This is a tremendous lag compared to the subsecond build time I'd become accustomed to. After much Googling and some hair-pulling, I found the culprits.

{% highlight text %}
.
├── bower_components
└── node_modules
{% endhighlight %}

I'd recently started using NPM and Bower for that site. By not having the underscore on the package download folders, I was asking Jekyll to include an unneeded 12,000+ files in each build. Ouch!

The workaround for this is very easy and there were a couple of choices. If you're using Bower, you can customize it's download directory by making a `.bowerrc` file.

{% highlight text %}
{
  "directory": "_bower_components/"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Node doesn't allow customization of the `node_modules` directory but we can alternately exclude via [_config.yml](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/), Jekyll's site configuration file.
{% highlight yaml %}
exclude:
  - bower_components
  - node_modules
{% endhighlight %}

The exclude option is very handy, especially when you can't or don't want to deal with underscores.

{% highlight yaml %}
exclude:
  - bower_components
  - bower.json
  - CNAME
  - gulpfile.js
  - node_modules
  - license.md
  - package.json
  - README.md
  - npm-debug.log
{% endhighlight %}


After making those changes, I was back to seeing the heart-warming subsecond build times again. Yay!

{% highlight yaml %}
