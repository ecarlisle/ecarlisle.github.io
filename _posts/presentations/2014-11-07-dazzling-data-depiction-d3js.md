<p>Creating data visualizations for a web has historically been a daunting task. Due to a lacking standards of browser-supported visualization, often the most approachable solutions would involve proprietary platforms, 3rd-party services, browser plugins, or just static imagery.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The D3.js JavaScript library uses HTML, CSS, and SVG for binding data to web documents. This standards-based approach allows visualizations to be created across browsers without the need for 3rd-party tooling.</p>

<p>This session will introduce the basics of D3.js and step through the process of building data-bound visualizations. Examples will include building visualizations with SVG or the HTML DOM.</p>

<p>Attendees should have a basic understanding of modern Web fundamentals including HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript.</p>
