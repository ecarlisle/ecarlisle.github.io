In only the last few years, Responsive Design patterns and paradigms have brought forth spectacular, sweeping changes in UI web production. The demands for device-compliance as well as the always-growing mobile market have made Responsive Design a necessity for many websites and web applications. While taking the Responsive approach may offer incredible opportunities, it also carries a gamut of challenges.

This session will cover best practices for the planning, production, and management of Responsive websites. It will also serve as an introduction to Responsive website creation using the Bootstrap 3 framework. We will explore the mechanics of the Bootstrap grid and explore how it may be used to create robust, flexible Responsive layouts. Topics central to the presentation include mobile-first production, content focus, site maintainability and performance.
