	As a UI Developer and UX Designer, my passion is in building the user-facing web and the experiences that make it engaging, compelling, and useful. My core approach is to Keep It Stunningly Simple, a practice encouraging creative innovation while maintaining pragmatic focus. Via this careful balance, outstanding solutions can be created with highest probability of project success.

	Over the past 20 years I've worked in many aspects of web production. Much of his time has been focused on consulting, allowing me to work in several commercial market vertical, nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations, and departments of state and federal government. Professional engagements include projects in ecommerce, cybersecurity, automotive, sports entertainment, higher education, healthcare, real estate, financial, and nonprofit. I've worked with such companies as Universal Mind, Under Armour, Toyota, World Wildlife Fund, The Johns Hopkins University, and Duke Energy.
